[10:20:43] @ORCHESTRATOR: @AllAgents - RELAUNCH — Round 2/5

The previous round's implementation was verified and the following gaps were identified.
Your job is to address these gaps. DecisionsTracker.md has been preserved from previous rounds.

## Gaps to Address
**

## Summary

The v3 plan was designed to fix two UX issues from a **completed v2 implementation**, but the codebase is still in **v1 state**. Phase 01 (scroll-indicator-and-button-fix.md) was never executed.

### Critical Gaps Found:

| Success Criterion | Status | Details |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| Scroll indicator at hero bottom | ❌ MISSING | No `.scroll-indicator` or `.scroll-chevron` elements in `index.html` or CSS |
| Chevron horizontally centered & bounces | ❌ MISSING | No `@keyframes scrollBounce` in `style.css` |
| Chevron respects `prefers-reduced-motion` | N/A | Chevron doesn't exist |
| Chevron has `aria-hidden="true"` | ❌ MISSING | Element doesn't exist |
| "I Want This" button centered | ❌ MISSING | **Interest section doesn't exist** - `index.html` has no `<section id="interest">` |
| No duplicate CSS blocks | ✅ N/A | No Interest CTA CSS exists to duplicate |
| Zero regression | ✅ PASS | Existing functionality intact |
| No console errors | ✅ PASS | Forms work, animations work |

### Root Cause:
The **v3 plan assumes v2 is complete**, but the codebase is in v1 state:
- Hero still has the "I Need This" CTA button (v2 should have removed it)
- No Interest section exists between Solution and Signup (v2 should have added it)
- Footer still shows 2025 copyright and social links (v2 should have updated these)
- Solution copy still says "Our AI listens" (v2 should have changed to "We listen")

The DecisionsTracker contains v2 implementation decisions but v2 was never actually applied to the HTML. The JS has interest button handling code (lines 64-100 in `main.js`), but the corresponding HTML elements don't exist.

### What Needs to Be Done:
1. Either complete v2 first (add interest section, update hero, update copy)
2. Or update v3 plan to include all missing v2 work plus the v3 fixes

## Instructions
1. Read the plan files and DecisionsTracker.md for full context
2. Focus on the gaps listed above — these are the priority
3. If a gap cannot be addressed, record why in DecisionsTracker.md
4. Continue following your persona guidelines for collaboration and quality

Begin by reviewing the gaps and the codebase, then work to close them.

[10:21:31] @DESIGNER: Let me also check the current state of the codebase and the DecisionsTracker to understand the full picture.Now let me check the CSS to see the current state of the scroll indicator and interest button styles:So the scroll indicator HTML exists (lines 100-102) but the CSS is missing. Let me check what CSS rules we do have and where to add the missing styles:Now I have a clear picture. The HTML has the scroll indicator elements (lines 100-102), but the CSS is completely missing the scroll indicator styles AND the interest section styles. Let me now respond to the team:

---

@Team — @Designer checking in. I've reviewed the codebase and the gap analysis. Here's my assessment from a design perspective:

**Current State:**
- ✅ HTML structure is correct: `.scroll-indicator` and `.scroll-chevron` elements exist at lines 100-102
- ✅ Interest section HTML exists with the button
- ❌ **CSS completely missing** for both scroll indicator and interest section

**What's Needed — Design Specs:**

### 1. Scroll Indicator (Chevron)
Per the plan, I'll design this as:
- **Shape:** CSS-drawn chevron (rotated square border) — modern, not a unicode character
- **Size:** 24×24px chevron
- **Color:** `var(--text-muted)` (#7a7a90) — subtle, decorative
- **Animation:** `scrollBounce` keyframes — gentle vertical bounce (8px), opacity cycling 0.4↔0.8, 2s infinite
- **Position:** Pushed to bottom of hero via `margin-top: auto` (flex column child)
- **Padding:** 1.5rem bottom breathing room

### 2. Interest Section
- **Button centering:** Parent `.interest-content` needs `text-align: center` explicitly
- **Button sizing:** 1.3rem font, generous padding (1.2rem × 3rem)
- **Clicked state:** Green gradient, `pointer-events: none`
- **Mobile:** Full-width button on 768px and below

**The hero-visual styles need adjustment too** — per plan, should be `max-width: 600px` and `margin-top: 2rem` (currently 3rem and 500px). This helps fill the "empty" feel.

@Dev — I'll document the exact CSS specs now. Can you implement these additions to `style.css`? The placement should be:
1. Scroll indicator styles after line 307 (after `.music-note:nth-child(3)`)
2. Interest section styles after line 441 (after Solution section, before Signup)
3. Add responsive interest button styles inside the `@media (max-width: 768px)` block

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:21:32] @SECURITY: Let me check the decisions tracker and the current state of the codebase to understand the security implications.Let me also check the CSS for security headers and the main.js for any security concerns.Now let me check the CSS for the scroll indicator styles and verify the gaps.Let me check the CSS file for any existing scroll indicator and interest section styles.Now I have a complete picture. I see that:
1. **The HTML has the scroll indicator** (lines 100-102) with `aria-hidden="true"` ✓
2. **The HTML has the interest section** (lines 157-167) ✓
3. **The CSS is MISSING scroll indicator styles** (no `.scroll-indicator`, `.scroll-chevron`, or `@keyframes scrollBounce`)
4. **The CSS is MISSING interest section styles** (no `#interest`, `.interest-content`, `.interest-btn`)
5. **Footer still shows 2025** (line 273 shows "© 2025 Transpose")
6. **Footer still has social links** (lines 269-272)

Let me respond with my security assessment.

---

@Team — Security joining. I've completed my review of the current codebase state and security posture.

## Security Assessment Summary

### ✅ **Security Controls Already in Place**
1. **CSP Headers** — Both `_headers` (Netlify) and `vercel.json` (Vercel) have proper Content-Security-Policy with restrictive defaults
2. **Honeypot Fields** — Forms include `_gotcha` hidden fields for bot mitigation
3. **Input Validation** — `maxlength` attributes present on all text inputs (Decision #6)
4. **Privacy Note** — Added to feedback form as per Decision #4
5. **Form Action Collision Fixed** — Decision #7 documents the `name="action"` → `name="event_type"` fix
6. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** — Prevents clickjacking
7. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** — Prevents MIME-type sniffing
8. **Referrer-Policy** — Properly configured

### ⚠️ **Gaps Found (Non-Security, but Noted)**
The orchestrator correctly identified that **CSS is missing** for the scroll indicator and interest section — the HTML elements exist but have no styling. This is a UI gap, not a security gap.

The footer has incorrect year (2025 → should be 2026) and still has social links — per Phase 02 cleanup plan.

### 🔒 **Security Recommendations for Current Round**

None critical. The security posture is solid for a pre-launch landing page. The CSP is appropriately restrictive and allows only:
- Scripts: `'self'` only
- Styles: `'self'`, inline, and Google Fonts
- Connections: `'self'` and Formspree
- Frames: `'none'`

**One minor note:** When the team adds the missing CSS for scroll indicator animation (`@keyframes scrollBounce`), no CSP changes are needed — CSS animations don't trigger CSP.

@Dev — The CSS gaps are yours to close. I'll re-review after implementation to ensure no regressions in the security headers.

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:21:36] @SRE: Let me also check the current state of the codebase and the DecisionsTracker to understand what's already been done.Let me check the current state of the index.html to understand what v2 work is missing:Good, I see the HTML has the scroll indicator already (lines 100-102). Let me check the CSS for the scroll indicator styles and look for duplicate CSS blocks:The scroll indicator CSS is missing! Let me also check the interest section CSS and verify the footer state:Now I have a clear picture. The CSS file has 617 lines total, and I can see:

1. **HTML has scroll indicator** (lines 100-102) but **CSS is missing** - no `.scroll-indicator` or `.scroll-chevron` styles
2. **HTML has interest section** (lines 157-167) but **CSS is missing** - no `#interest` or `.interest-*` styles
3. **Footer has 2025 copyright** (should be 2026 per plan)
4. **Footer still has social links** (plan says to remove them per v2 phase)

Let me respond to the team:

@Team I'm @Sre checking in. I've completed my audit of the codebase and found the following gaps from an infrastructure/deployment readiness perspective:

**Critical CSS Missing (prevents proper rendering):**
1. **Scroll indicator styles** - HTML has `.scroll-indicator` and `.scroll-chevron` elements (index.html lines 100-102), but style.css has NO corresponding CSS rules. The chevron won't render.
2. **Interest section styles** - HTML has `<section id="interest">` with `.interest-content`, `.interest-prompt`, `.interest-btn` elements (lines 157-167), but style.css has NO `#interest` or `.interest-*` rules. Button won't be styled or centered.

**Footer issues (v2 cleanup incomplete):**
3. Copyright shows `© 2025` (line 273) — should be 2026
4. Social links still present (lines 269-272) — v2 plan said to remove them

**Deploy readiness checks:**
- ✅ `_headers` file exists for Netlify
- ✅ `vercel.json` exists for Vercel deployment
- ✅ `.gitignore` exists

**My recommendation:** We need to add the missing CSS immediately. I can provide the exact CSS blocks from the plan spec:

1. Scroll indicator CSS (per phase-01-scroll-indicator-and-button-fix.md):
   - `@keyframes scrollBounce` 
   - `.scroll-indicator { margin-top: auto; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; }`
   - `.scroll-chevron` with border-based chevron + animation

2. Interest section CSS (per phase-01-hero-and-cta-restructure.md):
   - `#interest { text-align: center; padding: 3rem 1.5rem 4rem; }`
   - `.interest-content`, `.interest-prompt`, `.interest-btn`, `.interest-btn.clicked`

@Dev — Want me to draft the exact CSS additions, or are you already on this?

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:21:39] @QA: Let me get more context by checking the current state of the codebase and the DecisionsTracker.Good, I now have full context. I can see the codebase has been partially updated — the scroll indicator exists in HTML (lines 100-102), and the Interest section exists (lines 157-167). However, the orchestrator mentioned gaps. Let me check the CSS to verify the scroll indicator and button centering, then run a full QA pass.Found the gaps! The HTML has the scroll indicator and interest section, but the **CSS for both is missing**. Let me also check for duplicate CSS blocks that were supposed to be removed:Let me see the full CSS file to understand its structure and where the missing styles need to be added:Now I have a complete picture. Let me respond to the team with my QA assessment:

---

@Team QA joining. I've completed my initial audit and found the **critical gaps**:

## QA Gap Assessment — v3 Phase 01

| Gap | Status | Impact |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **Scroll indicator HTML** | ✅ EXISTS | Lines 100-102 in `index.html` — `scroll-indicator` and `scroll-chevron` divs present with `aria-hidden="true"` |
| **Scroll indicator CSS** | ❌ MISSING | No `.scroll-indicator`, `.scroll-chevron`, or `@keyframes scrollBounce` in `style.css` |
| **Interest section HTML** | ✅ EXISTS | Lines 157-167 in `index.html` — section, button, form all present |
| **Interest section CSS** | ❌ MISSING | No `#interest`, `.interest-content`, `.interest-btn`, `.interest-prompt` styles |
| **Interest button responsive** | ❌ MISSING | No mobile styling for `.interest-btn` |
| **Duplicate CSS blocks** | N/A | No Interest CTA CSS exists to have duplicates |

## Additional Issues Found
1. **Footer copyright still 2025** (line 273) — v2 plan said update to 2026
2. **Footer still has social links** (lines 269-272) — v2 plan said remove them
3. **Hero still has `.hero-cta` CSS** (lines 219-221, 261-264, 685-688) — v2 removed the button, but CSS remains (dead code)

## Root Cause
The HTML for v3 was added but the corresponding CSS was never implemented. The chevron and interest button will render as **invisible/unstyled elements**.

## What @Dev Needs to Add to `style.css`

**1. Before line 310 (before `/* Reduced Motion */`):**
```css
/* Scroll Indicator */
@keyframes scrollBounce {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 0.4;
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(8px);
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}

.scroll-indicator {
  margin-top: auto;
  padding-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

.scroll-chevron {
  width: 24px;
  height: 24px;
  border-right: 2px solid var(--text-muted);
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--text-muted);
  transform: rotate(45deg);
  margin: 0 auto;
  animation: scrollBounce 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**2. After Solution Section (after line 440), before Signup Section:**
```css
/* ============================================
   Interest CTA Section
   ============================================ */
#interest {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 3rem 1.5rem 4rem;
}

.interest-content {
  max-width: var(--max-width);
  margin: 0 auto;
  text-align: center;
}

.interest-prompt {
  color: var(--text-secondary);
  font-size: 1.15rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

.interest-btn {
  font-size: 1.3rem;
  padding: 1.2rem 3rem;
}

.interest-btn.clicked {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4ade80, #22c55e);
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

**3. In the responsive section (after line 708), add:**
```css
/* Interest CTA: full-width button on mobile */
.interest-btn {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**4. Cleanup v2 gaps:**
- Update footer copyright from 2025 → 2026 (line 273 in HTML)
- Remove footer social links (lines 269-272 in HTML)
- Remove dead `.hero-cta` CSS (lines 219-221, 261-264, 685-688)

I'll run a live browser test once @Dev confirms these CSS additions.

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:21:42] @PM: Let me also check the DecisionsTracker to understand the full context.Now let me quickly scan the current state of the codebase to understand what we're working with.Good. Let me check the current HTML to understand what state we're in:Interesting! The gaps report might be stale. It looks like the scroll indicator and interest section DO exist. Let me verify the CSS has the scrollBounce animation:So we have:
- ✅ Interest section exists
- ✅ Scroll indicator HTML exists
- ❌ **scrollBounce CSS animation is MISSING**
- ✅ Copyright shows 2026

This is the actual gap. Let me verify the CSS situation more carefully:Got it. The HTML has the scroll indicator element but the CSS animation and styles are completely missing. Let me check the interest button centering CSS as well:So the critical gaps are:
1. **No CSS for scroll indicator** - animation and styling missing
2. **No CSS for interest section** - button centering styles missing

Now I understand the situation clearly. Let me write my PM assessment to the team.

@Team - **PM Assessment: Round 2 Gap Analysis**

I've reviewed the codebase and the gap report. Here's the actual state:

**Good News - HTML is Complete:**
- ✅ Scroll indicator HTML exists (`<div class="scroll-indicator">`)
- ✅ Interest section exists (`<section id="interest">`) with "I Want This" button
- ✅ Footer shows 2026 copyright
- ✅ `aria-hidden="true"` on scroll indicator
- ✅ JS for interest button already wired up

**The Real Gaps - CSS is Missing:**
| Item | Status | What's Missing |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Scroll indicator animation | ❌ | No `.scroll-indicator`, `.scroll-chevron`, or `@keyframes scrollBounce` in CSS |
| Interest button centering | ❌ | No `#interest` or `.interest-btn` CSS styles |

**Acceptance Criteria (from plan phase-01-scroll-indicator-and-button-fix.md):**
1. Chevron bounces with CSS-drawn borders (`∨` shape)
2. Uses `margin-top: auto` to push to bottom of flex hero
3. Bounces 8px with 2s cycle, opacity 0.4→0.8
4. Interest section has `text-align: center`
5. No duplicate CSS blocks (need to verify)

**@Dev** - The fix is straightforward CSS work. The plan specifies exactly what to add in Task 01.1 (scroll indicator styles) and Task 01.2 (interest section centering). I recommend:

1. Add the scroll indicator styles after the hero visual animation rules (per plan)
2. Add/verify the interest section CSS block
3. Check for any duplicate CSS blocks and remove

**@QA** - Once CSS is added, please verify:
- Chevron appears at hero bottom and bounces
- Interest button is centered on 375px, 768px, and 1440px
- `prefers-reduced-motion` stops the animation

The scope is clear and surgical. Let's close these gaps.

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:22:18] @DESIGNER: I see all team members have provided their assessments. There's one disagreement I should clarify from a design perspective:

- @PM says footer shows 2026 copyright ✅
- @QA and @SRE say footer shows 2025 ❌

Let me quickly verify this, as it affects the scope of work:Good — I can see the footer shows **2026** and the social links have already been removed. @PM was correct, while @QA and @SRE's reports were based on stale info in the orchestrator gap report.

I should clarify this for the team so @Dev doesn't waste time on footer changes:

---

@Team — Quick design clarification on scope:

**Footer is already correct:**
- ✅ Copyright shows 2026 (line 268)
- ✅ Social links already removed

The gap report from the orchestrator was stale. @Dev should **not** touch the footer.

**Actual scope is just CSS additions:**
1. Scroll indicator styles (`@keyframes scrollBounce`, `.scroll-indicator`, `.scroll-chevron`)
2. Interest section styles (`#interest`, `.interest-content`, `.interest-prompt`, `.interest-btn`)
3. Responsive mobile styles for `.interest-btn`

Also noting: @QA mentioned removing dead `.hero-cta` CSS. That's optional cleanup — not blocking for the v3 acceptance criteria. I'd keep it as a low-priority item.

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:22:50] @QA: Good, @Designer has clarified that the footer is correct (2026, no social links) and narrowed the scope. The team is aligned. I need to verify this before @Dev starts work — if the footer is actually correct, my earlier assessment needs correction. Let me verify:Wait — I see a discrepancy. Earlier when I viewed the full HTML, lines 269-272 showed social links and line 273 showed 2025 copyright. But now lines 264-270 show a different footer with 2026 and no social links. The file may have been updated during the round. Let me verify the actual line count:The file now has 261 lines (down from 280 when I first read it). Someone has already cleaned up the footer. @Designer is correct — the footer is already fixed. I need to update my assessment.

---

@Team — **QA Correction:** @Designer is right. I re-verified the footer:

- ✅ **Line 268:** `© 2026 Transpose. All rights reserved.`
- ✅ **Social links removed** — footer is now only 6 lines
- ✅ **File is 261 lines** (down from 280)

The footer cleanup was completed after my initial audit. My earlier gap list about footer issues is now **invalid**.

**Revised QA scope for @Dev:**
1. ❌ Scroll indicator CSS — still missing
2. ❌ Interest section CSS — still missing  
3. ❌ Interest button mobile responsive — still missing
4. ~~Footer copyright~~ — ✅ already 2026
5. ~~Footer social links~~ — ✅ already removed
6. ⚠️ Dead `.hero-cta` CSS — optional cleanup (low priority)

Ready to verify once CSS is added.

SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[10:24:42] @DEV: Let me examine the current codebase state and the DecisionsTracker to understand what's already been done.Now let me check the CSS for the scroll indicator styles:Now I have a clear picture. Let me introduce myself and address the gaps.

---

**@Team** — @Dev here, taking lead on this round.

## Current State Analysis

The orchestrator's gap report was based on a stale analysis. Looking at the **actual codebase**, I can confirm:

### Already Present ✅
1. **Interest section exists** — `index.html` lines 157-167 has the `<section id="interest">` with button and hidden form
2. **Scroll indicator HTML exists** — `index.html` lines 100-102 has the `.scroll-indicator` and `.scroll-chevron` elements with `aria-hidden="true"`
3. **Solution copy is v2** — "We listen" not "Our AI listens" (line 146)
4. **Hero has no CTA button** — correct per v2

### Actually Missing ❌
1. **Scroll indicator CSS** — `.scroll-indicator`, `.scroll-chevron`, `@keyframes scrollBounce` are **not in style.css**
2. **Interest section CSS** — No styling for `#interest`, `.interest-content`, `.interest-prompt`, `.interest-btn`
3. **Footer shows 2025** — Should be 2026 (line 273)
4. **Footer still has social links** — Should be removed per cleanup phase

## Action Plan

I'll fix all gaps now:

1. Add scroll indicator CSS (keyframes + styles)
2. Add interest section CSS
3. Fix footer year to 2026
4. Remove footer social links
5. Add mobile responsive rules for interest button

Let me implement:The footer was already fixed in a previous round. Let me verify the CSS now:Now let me remove the footer-links CSS since that HTML is gone:Now let me also remove the dead `.hero-cta` CSS rules since the hero CTA button no longer exists:I see there's no `.hero-cta` animation anymore (it was already cleaned up from a previous round). Let me check the responsive section for any lingering `.hero-cta` rules:The `.hero-cta` rule is already gone. The CSS must have been regenerated in a prior round. All the responsive styles look correct.

Now let me run a quick verification by opening the site with a local server to check for any console errors:Server is running. Let me use Playwright to verify the page renders correctly and check for console errors:Let me check for console errors and take a screenshot to see the scroll indicator:I can see the scroll indicator chevron at the bottom of the hero (the subtle `∨` shape). The CSS is working.

I notice the SVG visual seems incomplete — the musical notes on the right side aren't visible. Let me investigate and also scroll down to verify the interest section:Footer looks correct — 2026 copyright, no social links. Let me scroll to the interest section to verify button centering:**"I Want This" button is centered!** ✅

Let me test the button functionality and verify the interest section works correctly:The button works:
- Changed to "✓ You want this!" ✅
- Scrolled to signup section ✅
- Formspree 404 is expected (placeholder ID)

Let me check the solution section connectors and run a mobile test:Solution section looks good — step connectors visible, correct v2 copy. Now let me test mobile viewport:Mobile interest section looks great — full-width button, clicked state showing. Let me check the hero scroll indicator and solution connectors on mobile:Mobile hero looks good — scroll chevron visible at bottom, readable text, SVG waveform visible. Let me check solution section for hidden connectors:Mobile solution section — steps stacked vertically, **no connectors** (correctly hidden). All responsive behavior working.

Let me close the browser and server:---

[10:25:10] @DESIGNER: Excellent! @Dev has implemented all the CSS changes and verified them. The scroll chevron bounces, the interest button is centered, and all acceptance criteria are met. From a design perspective, I should verify the visual implementation matches my specs.All the CSS matches my design specs exactly:

**Scroll indicator:**
- ✅ 24×24px chevron
- ✅ `var(--text-muted)` color via borders
- ✅ `margin-top: auto` to push to bottom
- ✅ `scrollBounce` 2s infinite animation with 8px bounce and 0.4↔0.8 opacity

**Interest section:**
- ✅ `text-align: center` on content wrapper
- ✅ 1.3rem font, 1.2rem × 3rem padding on button
- ✅ Green gradient clicked state with `pointer-events: none`

---

@Team — **@Designer sign-off:** The CSS implementation matches all design specs exactly.

- ✅ Scroll chevron: 24px, muted color, 2s bounce with opacity fade
- ✅ Interest button: centered, generous padding, clean clicked state
- ✅ Mobile: full-width button

@Dev did excellent work. No design issues.

@QA — Ready for your final verification pass.

SATISFACTION_STATUS: SATISFIED

[10:25:25] @QA: @Dev has implemented all the CSS fixes and run verification. They're reporting SATISFIED. As QA, I need to independently verify the implementation before confirming. Let me run my own verification pass.Excellent! The CSS is now in place. Let me verify the key acceptance criteria are met:All CSS is correctly implemented. Let me also verify no duplicate CSS blocks exist (a requirement from the plan):- ✅ Only 1 Interest CTA Section CSS block (no duplicates)
- ✅ Dead `.footer-links` CSS removed

Now I'll respond to the team with my verification:

[12:04:19] @ORCHESTRATOR: @AllAgents - Welcome to Mandali!

You are an autonomous team implementing 
**PHASED PLAN STRUCTURE** - Read files in this order:
1. `C:\Projects\transpose-landing-mandali-20260212-120401\phases\_CONTEXT.md` - Global context (READ FIRST)
2. `C:\Projects\transpose-landing-mandali-20260212-120401\phases\_INDEX.md` - Phase index and status tracking
3. Individual phase files in `C:\Projects\transpose-landing-mandali-20260212-120401\phases/phase-*.md`

## PHASE 0A: CONTEXT BUILDING (Before Design Discussion)

Before discussing the design, each agent MUST build a complete understanding:

### Required Actions for EACH Agent:
1. **Read _CONTEXT.md FIRST** (if phased plan) - contains global architecture, security, non-negotiables
2. **Read _INDEX.md** (if phased plan) - shows phase status and dependencies
3. **Read the relevant phase file(s)** - understand tasks and quality gates
4. **Explore the codebase** - understand project structure, patterns, conventions
5. **Launch background agents** if needed to explore large codebases efficiently
6. **Understand dependencies** - what exists, what needs to be built

### Your Tools:
- Use `view` to read files
- Use `glob` and `grep` to explore the codebase
- Use `task` tool with agent_type="explore" for parallel codebase exploration
- Take your time - understanding the full picture is critical

### When Ready:
Each agent should post: "@Team - I have reviewed the plan and codebase. Ready for design discussion."

**Wait for ALL agents to confirm readiness before starting design discussion.**

---

## PHASE 0B: DESIGN DISCUSSION (After All Agents Ready)

Once ALL agents confirm readiness, begin design discussion:

1. **@PM**: Present the plan, clarify acceptance criteria, lead the discussion
2. **@Security**: Raise ALL security concerns NOW (not during implementation)
3. **@Dev**: Propose technical approach, identify risks, suggest phase adjustments
4. **@QA**: Propose test strategy for each phase
5. **@SRE**: Propose observability requirements

**Rules for Design Discussion:**
- ALL agents must participate and acknowledge the plan
- @Security must approve the security approach BEFORE implementation begins
- Team may reorder phases, add sub-phases, or adjust scope
- @PM declares design complete with: "@Team design discussion complete, begin Phase 1"

---

## Phased Plan Workflow (if using phases/ structure)

After each phase is complete:
1. @PM updates `_INDEX.md` with: ✅ Complete, commit hash
2. @PM verifies `DecisionsTracker.md` has entries for any deviations made during this phase — if choices were made that differ from the plan or where the plan was silent, they must be recorded before moving on
3. @PM announces: "@Team Phase X complete, proceeding to Phase Y"
4. If plan says "STOP after Phase X", team stops and reports to human

---

## Communication
- Use @mentions: @Dev, @PM, @Security, @QA, @SRE, @Team, @AllAgents
- End each message with SATISFACTION_STATUS

## Victory Condition
All agents SATISFIED = Implementation complete.

---

@AllAgents - Begin by reading the plan and exploring the codebase. 
Post when you're ready for design discussion.
