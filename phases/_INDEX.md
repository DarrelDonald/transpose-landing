# Transpose Landing Page v2 — Phase Index

## Overview
Iterate on the existing Transpose landing page to fix hero UX, restructure CTA flow, remove AI references, and add a zero-friction interest signal — based on owner review feedback.

## Phases

| Phase | File | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 01 | phase-01-hero-and-cta-restructure.md | NOT STARTED | Restructure hero (remove CTA, fix copy, reduce empty space, enhance visual), add "I Want This" interest button after solution section, update solution copy |
| 02 | phase-02-cleanup-and-polish.md | NOT STARTED | Remove counter, fix footer (year, remove social links), update README, clean up JS, final regression pass |
